### If and Whether

They are the same when they are used as noun clauses.
- Do you know if Dan is coming?
- Do you know whether Dan is coming (or not)?

- I don't know whether the exam is on Friday or Saturday. (Friday or Saturday)
- I don't know if the exam is on Friday or Saturday. (Friday or Saturday or another day)

**Suggestion**:
- Use `if` only for conditional sentences.
- Use `whether` only for giving 2 alternatives.

- Let me know if you're coming. (if you are coming -> tell me)
- Let me know whether you're coming or not. (tell me about your decision)

- I'll come over if you want me to. (Giving a condition with if)
- I'll come over whether you like it or not. (Show the regardless)

When you use **whether** to mean **regardless**, you have to use both options together. (You cannot omit `or not` in the last sentence.
