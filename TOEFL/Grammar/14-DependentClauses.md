### Dependent Clauses and their functions:

There are 4 types:
1. Noun Clause
2. Adjective Clause (Relative Clause)
3. Adverb Clause
4. That Clause

#### Noun Clauses:

It is used like a noun.

1. As a Subject
- What you do in your free time is your busniess.
- It is your business what you do in your free time. 
In this sentence `it` is a `preparatory if`. It means that it is prepraing your for the coming subject later.

2. As a Subject Complement (= It comes after a `be` verb and completes the meaning of the subject).
- Tom isn't what you'd call friendly.

**HINT: the conjunction `what` only can be used in noun clause.**

3. As an Object:
- She said (that) she was sorry.

4. As the Object of prepositions:
- I don't worry about **what others think**.

5. As the Object of the non-main verb:
- I really want to believe **that tomorrow will be better**.

#### Adjective Clauses:

1. Identifying clauses (no commas) - If the clause is taken out, the identity of the subject is unknown because it is too general.
	- The girl **who sold me the car** said it was hers.

2. Non-identifying clauses (commas before and after the clause) - The reader knows the identity of the subject. So the clause is extra information about it.
	- My high school English teacher**, who is retired and now lives in Florida,** sent me a postcard.

3. Situational clauses. (commas) They don't modify the noun, and they modify the entire phrase or situation.
	- I bought myself a motorcycle for my birthday**, which made my wife crazy**. (The situation made her crazy, not the birthday)

**HINTS**: 
- We use `that` in `identifying adjective clauses`. (without commas)
- We use `which` in `non-identifying adjective clauses`. (with commas)

#### Adverb Clauses:

-> Show a relationship between independent and dependent clauses.
- For example: contrast, condition, reason, time, ...

**Examples:**

1. Although he practiced every day, he didn't win. (contrast)

2. If you help me pass this test, I will buy you lunch. (condition)

3. I lent her my notes because she missed too many classes. (reason)

4. When my mother, who was only 18 when she had me, told me I should wait until I got older to marry Luccy, I knew she was really happy I met the right person.

	- `When my mother` -> adverb clause
	- `who was only 18 when she had me` -> non-identifying adjective clause.
	- `I should wait` -> noun clause, the object of `told`.
	- `until I got older` -> adverb clause for wait.
	- `to marry Lucy` -> a compelemnt.
	- `I knew she was really happy` -> indpendent clause.
	- `(that) I met the right person` -> a that clause which is a complement.
