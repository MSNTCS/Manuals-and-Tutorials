> 2. Joe took a week off work so that his wife could take a training course.

> 3. You should stay home because if you go out, there will be trouble.
- In this sentence we have an adverb clause inside another one.
- You should stay home because there will be trouble. (also correct, but we want to emphasize the importance of `going`. Thus, we can add a condition.)
