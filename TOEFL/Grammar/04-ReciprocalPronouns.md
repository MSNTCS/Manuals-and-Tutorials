### Reciprocal Pronount: Each other, One another

**HINT**: These should not be mistaken with `themselves`.
**Themselves** is not a reciprocal pronoun. It is a `relexive pronoun`. 
- I hit myself (reflect to me).

1. Tom and Jerry hated each other. (The feeling is reciprocal)

2. Tom and Jerry hated one another. 

3. Tom and Jerry hated themselves. **It is not the same as 1st and 2nd sentences.**

4. Linda and Kate were bridesmade at each other's weddings. (Pay attention to `S` and `Apastrophe`)
