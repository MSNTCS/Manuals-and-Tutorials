## Passive 

### Why Using passive?

1. Subject is unknown/obvious/not important.

> - The building was vandalized.
> - The flowers were delivered on time.
> - The roads were fixed quickly.
> - The airplane was invented in the early 20th century.

**It's controversial to talk about the inventor(s)/subject.**

2. To shift focus of subject.

3. Sentence veriety.
> - He did A. Then, he did B. After that, he did C. -> **It's boring!**.
**You want a fun, alive, and engaging essay:**
> - He did A. C wasn't done until he had completed B.

4. Coherence and flow.

**Example for No.2 and 4. An essay about Coca-Cola:**

> Coca-cola was invented by a pharmacist named John Pemberton. (**Inventer is not important as the invention**) His original recipe contained cocain (**created the flow with active sentence**), which is why the drink was named Coca-cola. (**bring the reader back to the essay's subject**) Today, Coca-cola is a global brand that is consumed by millions of people. (**Again passive, because we don't want to focus on millions of people. We want to bring the attention to consumption.**)
