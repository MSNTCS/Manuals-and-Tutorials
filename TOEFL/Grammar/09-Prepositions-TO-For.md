## Situation that To and For are interchangeable:

1. **To Express reason:**
> - I went to the store to *buy milk*. (we have a verb here)
> - I went to the store for *milk*. (we have a noun hear)

> - I went `to` the store. 
This `to` is used when there is a movement or a destination involved.
Almost all the time, we use `to` in a movement (showing direction):
> - walk, go, drive, take the bus, ...
> - **Exceptions**: head for the heals, make for the lobby, ...

2. **To point out a recepient**:

> - Give this to her. (give -> a motion)
> - This is for her. (recepient is like a destination)

> - Send this fax to her.
> - I made this cake for her. (make -> a situation NOT a movement)

> - Ask John to send me the file. (You expect he **sends** the file, action is important)
> - Ask John for the file. (You care about the thing, no matter how it reaches to you).

3. Invite:

> - Invite him to the party. (there is an Event)
> - Invite him for dinner. (no event)

4. Directed action vs. On behalf:

> - A: What did you do **to** him? B: I yeild **at** him. `directed action`
> - A: What did you do **for** him? B: I took his test **for** him. `on behalf`

5. As complement:
> - To **make** a perfect cake, use ...
> - For **a perfect cake**, use ...

6. Be used to / Be used for

1. `Be used to` = familiar, comfortable, ...
> - I'm used to the weather in Canada.

2. `Be used to` = to show purpose
> - The marker is used to write things with.

3. `Be used for` = use, purpose, ...
> - The marker is used for writing.
