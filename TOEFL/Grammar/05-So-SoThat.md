	- A: I like English.
	- B: So do I.
2. To refer to
	- A: She is beautiful.
	- B: If you think so, you should go talk to her. (so is referring to sth already mentioned.)
3. Quantifier (= very)
	- I am so hungery.
4. `So much/few` + noun, adj + noun = a lot
5. As a conjunction. (Coordinating conjunction)

	- Because I was late, I missed the meeting.

#### `So that` usages:

1. Adver clause marker, or Adver clause conjunction. -> used for showing purpose.
	- I worked overtime this week so that I could take time off next week. 

#### `So` + adj/adv + `that`: (another type of quantifier)

#### Examples:

1. Look at these sentences:

	- Bill worked hard, so he was promoted. (Promotion is the result of his hard work)
	- Bill worked hard so (that) he would be promoted. (Bill wants to be promoted, not promoted yet)
	- Bill worked so hard (that) he had to be promoted.

2. Pay attention to the use of `so` like the first group:

	- Jill is smart, so all the boys like her. (The result of her being smart is that boys like her)
	- Jill studies regularly so (that) she can beat the boys. (Jill is ambitious and want to be better than the boys.) (**Pay attention that `studies` is an action verb; we cannot use non-action verb here.**)
	- Jill is so smart (that) all the boys are afraid of her.
