## Adjective Clause (relative clause):

```
**The whole clause is like an adjective.**

- Two types:
1. Defining clause (no comma)
2. Modifying clause (comma)

**- They all begin with a relative pronoun:**
- *that/which/who/whom/whose/when/where/(why)*

**- Some of these can also be the subject of the dependent clause:**
- *that/which/who*

**- In some cases *that* can be removed.**

**Example:**
- The man lives nex door. (the meaning is incomplete; which man?)
- The man who lives next door is a doctor.
- Dr. Smith, who lives next door, is a retired surgeon. (Dr. Smith is a proper name)

- *Whome* can also be the object of the indpendent clause.
```

### Examples:

> 1. Jerry went to the same store where Jennifer bought her couch.
- **Hint**: The ajective clause almost comes right after the noun it modifies.

> 2. Frank went to study in Boston, where some of the world's best universities are based.

> 3. The only effort that matters in that which/that leads to a win.
- The first `that` is a demonstrative pronoun of `effort`.
- It is preferred to not use two `that`s right after another. In these cases, switch the second that with `which`.

> 4. Many students in Mrs. Reynold's class, who went on the field trip, are home sick with the flu that's going around.
- `who went on the field trip` is modifying `students`.
- `in Mrs. Reynold's class` is a prepositional phrase which completes the idea of students. It's defining the `students`. **As an intuitive rule (by me -> Amir), the defining clause/phrase comes before the non-defining clause/phrase.**
- It will a bit weird and confusing to move the clause close to `students`
- `that's going raound` is an adjective clause defining `flu`.

> 5. Larry failed his test, which means (that) he'll have to go to summer school.
- This `which` doesn't modify `test` ; it modifies the whole clause(*situation*) before it.
- `that he'll have to go to summer school` is a noun clause, acting as an object for `means`. 

> 6. The eccentric billionair, about whom the public knows little, donated millions to charity.
**- If the verb in the adjective clause has a preposition, put it before the relative pronoun.**
