`If + subject + negative present verb, ...`

- If you study, you will succeed. (you will not fail)
- If you don't study, you will fail. (you will not pass)

`Unless + s + positive present verb, ...` **Only positive.**

- Unless you study, you will fail.
- Unless you study, you will not succeed.

`As long as + S + negative/positive verb, ...`

- As long as you study, you will pass.
- As long as you don't study, you will fail.

#### Some other examples:

- If you quit smoking, you will feel better. (or -> you won't feel bad)
- If you don't quit smoking, you will feel bad. (or -> you won't feel good)
**Notice how the consequences change when the *if clause* is changed to negative.**

- Unless you quit smoking, you will feel bad. (you won't feel good)
- Unless you don't smoking, you will feel good. **-> Wrong**

- As long as you smoke, you will feel bad.
- As long as you don't smoke, you will feel good.
