## Noun Clause:
```
- It can be a dependent clause or a part of an independent clause. 

- Conjunctions (can be used to connect dependent clauses to independent ones):
** - that, which, who, whom, whose, what, if, whether, when, where, how, why**
** - whichever, whatever, whenever, wherever, who(m)ever**

**HINT:** Some of these conjunctions, like which, can be used as conjunction and the the subject of the dependent clause:
- *Which/who/what/whatever/whichever/whoever* -> can also be the subject
- *whom/whomever* -> can only be the object

**- Noun clause usages:**
1. Subject
2. Object
3. 
4. 
```

**1. Noun clause as the `subject`:**
> - What she wore to the party really turned some heads.
> `what she wore to the party` -> subject of `turned`

> - Whoever wants to know should ask me .
> `whoever wants to know` -> subject of `should ask`

**2. Noun clause as the `object`:**
```
**- Let's refresh our memories:**
- *Object* answers the question of *what/whom* about the verb.
- *Complement* answers the question of *what/whom* about the subject.

We have subject complements with be verbs, or any linking verbs like *seem*, *appears*, *looks like*, etc. These are not action verbs, they are situation verbs which are used like an **equal sign** or a **be verb**.
```
> - Please ask mom what we're having for dinner.
> `what we're having for dinner` -> object of `ask`

> - Do you know if she's coming?
> `if she's coming` -> object of `know`

**3. Noun clause as the `subject complement`:**
> - Paul isn't what is generally considered handsome.
> `what is generally cnosidered handsome` -> subject complement of `Paul`.

**4. Noun clause as the `object of a prepositons`:**
> - Sarah should not be held responsible for what her brother does.
> `what her brother does` -> object of preposition `for` not ~~the verb should no be held~~.

> - It's more a question of whom she sait it to than why she said it. 
> `whom she said it` -> object of preposition `of`
> `why she said it` -> object of preposition `than`

**5. Noun clause as the `adjective complement`:**
```
- In some cases the sentence is complete(grammarly), but the idea is not necessarily complete.
```
> - I am happy (that) you've decided to come.
> `that you've decide to come` -> adjective complement of `happy`

> - I'm unsure if he's coming.
> `if he's coming` -> adjective complement of `unsure`
> *If* here is not an adverb conjunction. It's a noun conjunction.

> - That she might be right is what frightens me.
> - How you go about doing your work should not affect when you get it done.
