## Comparisons

### Like + noun, as + clause

- These are used for comparing things or actions.

**Hints:**
1. `Like` is a preposition and followed by a noun.
2. `As` is a conjunction and followd by a clause (subject and verb).

**Examples:**
> - Do like I say, not like I do. -> **Wrong**
> - Do as I say, not as I do. -> **Right**

> - He looks like a Martian (from Mars).

> - He speaks like a preacher. (`he` is compared with `a peacher`)
> - He speaks as preacher does. (The way he speaks is compared here)

> She treats me like a dog. (me and dog are compared)

> A: I like it. B: As do I. (So do I)

> He speaks as Kennedy used to.

> She is shopping **as if** there were no tomorrow. (Unreal situation. Kind of subjunctive case).

> As your boss, I forbid your from using FB at work. (as = in the position of)
> Like your boss, I forbid your from using FB at work. (Like is comparing `me` with `your boss`)

### More + ... + than, ...er than, as ... as

> The comparisons are used for qualities.
