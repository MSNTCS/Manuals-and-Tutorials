## Mixed Conditionals:

- Normal Conditionals samples:
> - If I had known she was coming, I'd have come too. (**Unreal**)
> - If I won the lottery, I'd buy a house. (**Unreal**)
> - If you boil water, it evaporates. (**Real**)
> - If you study hard, you will pass the test. (**Real**)

- Mixed conditionals (understandable by looking at the context):
> - If you didn't study computers in high school, you might(will) find this course difficult. (`S. past -> future`)
**- The 2nd sentence implies the result of the condition. It is not about the dependence.**

> - If you didn't want to buy that shirt, you shouldn't have (bought it). (`S.past -> Pres.perf.`)

> - If you go to the party, I'll go, too. (`future -> future`)

> - If I had won the competition, I'd land a great job by now. (`Past Perf. -> Present`)

> - If I will follow me please, I'll show you to your table. (= please come this way!)

> - If it will help my case, I'll take the test. 
**- The relation here is not of dependence and condition. It is about the result and action.**

> - If I know how to cook, I'd have made you dinner instead.
**- The condition is not unreal, and it is true now.**

> - If I weren't so busy, I'd go with you.
> - If my parents weren't going away, I'd have invited you for the next weekend.
